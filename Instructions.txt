Install the latest (bit-type appropriate) version of Python 3.7.x from www.python.org

From command line:
	Navigate to the folder containing the scripts.
	Execute at the command line:  pip install -r requirements.txt

The above will install the necessary 3rd party modules for the script (Including JunosPyEZ)

!! Your device(s) will need to have netconf and ssh enabled and you will need appropriate credentials for the device(s) !!

*********

Update the routers_lsp.yml (text) file with appropriate credentials and device interface addresses of the routers in question.


*********

From the folder containing the script, you can now execute as:
python lspverify.py
	# This will look in the yaml configuration file for a list of routers under the "devices_to_query" header
	# and will, one at a time for now, pull and print all of the LSP information from those routers.
python lspverify.py <router IP>
	# The above will print all LSP information from one router with no error checking.
python lspverify.py <router IP 1> <router IP 2>
	# The above will print all of the LSP information from two routers with no error checking.
python lspverify.py <router IP 1> <router IP 2> --compare
	# The above will only print the LSP information from those two routers in which the LSP destination is the other router.
	# This also performs asymmetrical path checking on the _ACTIVE_ path of the LSP.
